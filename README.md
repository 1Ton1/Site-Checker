I built this program in python because I needed a way to check if server's and website's were online so I used python packages called click,
os, json and requests to make it work. Click made it easy to make a terminal based application that looked good and is simple to use.

You can find the source code in the script called site-checker.py

# HOW TO
Step 1: Have python 3.9 installed
Step 2: Run Site Checker.exe.

Thats it enjoy.
